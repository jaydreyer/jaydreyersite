title: Target Rocks...I Do Not.

<img style="margin: 4px; float: right;" src="http://jaydreyer.com/images/tgtlogo.jpg" alt="Target logo"/>Wednesday was Target's big, national stores sales meeting where everyone comes &nbsp;to Minneapolis to learn about what's planned for the upcoming year. Our group (the tech side) was invited this year to what used to be a stores-only event. I picked up my ticket and had every intention of attending but I had so much work to do I decided to skip it. I worked on test plans and studying process flows. By doing so, I missed the following performances (who knew?):

* Tony Bennett
* Elvis Costello
* Diana Krall
* kd lang (I think she spells it all lower case)
* Maroon 5
* Kenny Chesney

This was not a good move on my part. In my defense, I had no idea Target rolled out the big guns at these events. Now I know and I won't miss one again.

On a side note, if you're into community service, Target announced they're going to increase the amount they give to the community from $2 million a week to $3 million. I work for a very cool company.
