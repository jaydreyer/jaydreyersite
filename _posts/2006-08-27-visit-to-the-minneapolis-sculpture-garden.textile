We ventured downtown today and checked out the <a href="http://garden.walkerart.org/index.wac">Minneapolis Sculpture Garden.</a> It's a neat place right next to the Walker Art Center and the Basilica. Lot's to see, although it was a little bit toasty for Jack and Lucy. All in all, however, it was a nice time. It's good to get out once in a while!
