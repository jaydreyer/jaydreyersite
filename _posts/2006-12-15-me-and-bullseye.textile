We had our annual Target holiday (don't call it Christmas!) party yesterday and the surprise star of the show was Bullseye, the Target mascot. He's quite the trooper. He probably posed for about 300-400 pictures when all was said and done. I believe his name is Nick, but I might not have heard his handler correctly. He's well behaved, that's for sure.
