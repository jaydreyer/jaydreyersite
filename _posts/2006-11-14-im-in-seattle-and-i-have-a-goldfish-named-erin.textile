Right now I'm in Seattle for a conference with a big dot com company that starts with an A and ends with an N. I'll give you a few minutes to figure out who it is...

I'm staying at the very cool "Hotel Monaco":http://www.monaco-seattle.com/. I have a goldfish in my room who's name is Erin. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with Erin, but this is what the card says:

bq. My name is Erin, and I'm here to keep you company during your stay with us. I do hope it is an enjoyable one! You don't have to feed me or change my water. The housekeeping staff will take care of all that. All you have to do is have a great time while you are here. And perhaps talk to me every once in a while.

I think I can handle this. Erin seems to be a very cool fish and she/he seems to have a nice bowl to swim around in. If Jack was here with me, he would be enjoying this. The picture I took with my cell phone is pretty lousy, but you get the idea.

Seattle seems to be a neat city. We had a fantastic dinner at a place called "The Brooklyn":http://www.seattleweekly.com/food/restaurants/brooklynthe.php. I can't say more because it's dark out and we didn't have much time to take in the scenery. One thing that I've discovered, however, is that they have streets with hills similar to San Francisco.

I wanted to bring a camera along with me on the trip but I forgot. I might be able to borrow some pictures from my friend, Dustin, or I might just use my crappy cell phone camera.

I will also note that the hotel has provided me with not one, but two bath robes - one of which has a leopard skin pattern.
