I'm a big fan of lists. I think it goes back to my baseball card collecting days when I would spend hours organizing my cards and then creating lists of the ones I needed to complete a set. Once I tracked down the missing cards, I would cross the numbers off of my list until the page was a solid, continuous black line. You can't beat the feeling of crossing stuff off on a list. I'll even add things that I've completed that weren't on my original lists just to cross them off. I can't explain it.

Anyway, I love lists of movies to see, books to read, cd's to own, etc. As I find new ones, I'll share them with you here. If you have any good ones I should know about, pass 'em on.

I just displayed the excepts from each list. Click the title of the article to view the entire list.
