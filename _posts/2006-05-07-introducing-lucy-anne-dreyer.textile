Not much time to write but here is our new daughter, born at 1:13 AM on Saturday, May 6th. She weighed in at 7 lbs, 8 oz and was 20.5" long. The delivery took over 30 hours but DeAnne and Lucy are doing just great. 

Yes...Lucy is another clone of DeAnne, just like Jack.

*Update* Pictures of Lucy have been added to the gallery...
