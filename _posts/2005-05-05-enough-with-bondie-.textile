title: Enough With &#8220;Bondie&#8221;

OK...I've had it with Jim Price, color analyst of the Detroit Tigers, referring to Jeremy Bonderman as "Bondie".  Adding the "-ie" sound to the end of a player's name works great in hockey (Stevie, Shanny, Cheli, etc.) but that's about the only place. I'm OK with Higgy (the name, not the player) but Bondie just sounds wrong on so many levels. I don't care if that's his nickname around the clubhouse, either.

And it's not like Price says it once or twice a game. I think he's being paid by 1270 to say Bondie as many times as possible. Does Bonderman actually like being called Bondie? Is this possible? Bondie??? Ack. Enough.
