I've been so busy moving all of the sites to a new host, learning linux/Fedora/Debian, mySql, php, mambo and a million shell commands that I haven't had time to write about the 2005 MLB All-Star game at Comerica Park this year.

I lucked out in a huge way when my friend Glen told me he had an extra ticket to the Futures game/FanFest on Sunday, as well as the main event Tuesday night. $165, 2 hats and a blog shout out later, I was there. !{float: right; margin-bottom: 10px}/images/1.jpg (Glen and the Big Boy)!

It was awesome. A dream come true for me. The whole time I was at the game I kept thinking, "Damn! It's the all-star game...and it's here in Detroit...and I'm here!" My wife thinks I'm nuts but deep down I think she understands.

Al Kaline and Willie Horton threw out the first pitch, some guy I've never heard of sang the national anthem and we received a flyover by a Stealth bomber. The game itself was ok. The AL jumped out to a 7-0 lead, which was fine with me. We got to boo Kenny Rogers as he warmed up in the bullpen (our seats were in the first row of the upper deck, near the scoreboard...very cool), and we were fairly close to Tejada's home run early in the game. I took a few pictures and I might try to get those posted on here one way or another.

All in all, it was a fantastic night, despite the brief rain shower at the end of the game. The city looked great, and everything went smoothly. A lot of people that hadn't been to Detroit in a long time (including many from the suburbs) were impressed, I guess, which bodes well for the Super Bowl this January.
