!{float:right; margin:4px;}/images/moa.gif (The Mall of America)!
This weekend's grand adventure and immersion into Minneapolis living was a trip to the insanely huge "Mall of America":http://www.mallofamerica.com/adults.aspx. (Of course, we couldn't go to the Mall of America without stopping off first at Ikea. We just couldn't.)

We have tried to stay away from it, and reserve going there for when/if friends and family visit. But, few friends and family have visited, it was raining, and it has an indoor aquarium. And it's next to Ikea - key in DeAnne's reasoning.

So...what can I say about this place? It's big. Really big, as Shatner would say. It has an indoor amusement park, an underground aquarium (complete with sharks you can go swimming with - for $200. I asked if the sharks had frickin' laser beams attached to their heads. I was the only one who found this humorous besides Jack, who is my personal Ed McMahon.), a gazillion stores (I counted!), and tons of crappy fast food restaurants.

I think DeAnne and I are still dazed from the experience. We didn't even really shop. We just walked around, looked at stuff, checked out the aquarium and left. I tried to find a pen (I need a small pen I can hang on my keychain...these exist, right? Where can I find one?) but I didn't have much luck. We also went to Brooks Brothers where I found a great sports coat for, gulp, $500.  "No way," said DeAnne. "That's our new bathroom from Ikea!" I couldn't argue with her.

It's not a great place for really little kids, unless you're trying to lose them, in which case it's an excellent place. Jack liked the aquarium, Lego-land, and hide-and-seek in Brooks Brothers. Lucy seemed to enjoy the aquarium. It was like a real-life Baby Einstein video for her. DeAnne liked Ikea.

What did I like? Leaving.
