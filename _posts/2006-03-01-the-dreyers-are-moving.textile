That's right! After 15 years (for me) and a lifetime (for DeAnne and Jack) it's time to pack it up and move on to bigger and better things. DeAnne loosened the moving restrictions this year and agreed that the job market and future here in Detroit just isn't as promising as we'd like it to be. I'm not an automotive engineer/designer/etc., and after that, there's not much else to do here. 

So where are we headed? Minneapolis, Minnesota. I never imagined we'd end up there, but that's where we're going. I just accepted an offer to work for a really big retailer as a business analyst on their .com endeavors. The job and company are fantastic and I can't wait to get started. !{float:left; margin:4px;}/images/36.jpg (Target Dog)!

What I would like to wait on, however, is all of the upcoming activity preceding the move. In a short amount of time I need to sell our current house, find a new house in Minnesota, move, and figure out where our new child will be born. (Should DeAnne stay in Detroit and have the baby or will things work out so that we'll all be in Minnesota when the big day arrives?) Who knows? It's going to be a stressful couple of months but we're really excited about it.
