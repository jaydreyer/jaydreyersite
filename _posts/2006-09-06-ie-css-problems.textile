You know...you use Firefox long enough and you forget that there are still people out there using Internet Explorer. Such was the case with me when I started tinkering with the look of the site here. My xhtml validates, as does my css, but just because it's right doesn't mean it will work with IE.

Our good friend Amy dropped an email today and said the site looked like garbage on IE. She didn't say it quite like that, but after I took a look, I concluded it looked like dog poop. I made some small changes, made sure everything validated and hit the refresh button in IE and voila! It works. I can't tell you what I did to make it work because I have no idea.

So, thank you for the heads up, Amy. Now all of you IE users have no excuse not to visit my "Amazon store":http://www.jaydreyer.com/store and buy something.

*Update*
I really should have checked this sooner. Looking at my site stats, over 50% of the people who check out this site use Internet Explorer. Bad webmaster!
