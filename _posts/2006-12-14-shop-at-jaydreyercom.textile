Just a friendly reminder, after you watch the Wall of Voodoo video, be sure to do all of your holiday shopping through JayDreyer.com. How you say? Easy! Just click the "Store":http://www.jaydreyer.com/store link above and pretend you're at Amazon.com. You don't have to actually buy anything through my site, just click anything and it will store a magical cookie that will track sales back to the site. It doesn't have any affect (or is it effect...stupid English rules...) on what you'd pay normally so go for it.
