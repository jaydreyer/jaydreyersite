OK. I know this is slightly disgusting but I need a sanity check here. Is it now ok to clip your nails at work? In your cube?? Did I miss the memo on this? At my current assignment, I sit right next to three different people that clip their nails in their cubes. Not in the bathroom or outside, but right in their cubes. When did this become acceptable? Or am I going overboard here?

Clip...clip....clip.....clip. Ugh!
