You have to be kidding me! This is news??? Didn't Randy get pulled over in Minneapolis and found to be in possession of pot a couple years ago? Why is this news? I had the Cardinals/Diamondbacks on TV yesterday and every 28 minutes, John Buccigross would come on and announce to the world that Randy Moss admitted to smoking pot. Wow. Next thing you know they'll be telling me that Jason Giambi took steroids.
