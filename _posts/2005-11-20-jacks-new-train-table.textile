I finished up my son's train table the other night. The paint job is pretty bad but I'm still working on it. The table was built with poplar and the top is 3/4" birch-ply. I used my "Kreg pocket-hole-jig":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000051WSI/jaydreyer-20 to make the joints. That thing is awesome, btw. The joints it makes are really strong, too. That's  important when you'll have a monkey climbing all over it. Jack will be getting a new wooden train set to go with his table from Santa in December.

I based the design of the table on a similar item at "Pottery Barn Kids":http://ww2.potterybarnkids.com/cat/pip.cfm?gids=pk195&cmsrc=&src=rmsaa%7Ccromplygam%7Cda%7Crrooms.  Actually, it looks pretty much exactly like the one from Pottery Barn Kids. The difference is I painted mine and they stained theirs.
