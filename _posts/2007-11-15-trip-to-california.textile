OK...so this trip happened, like, months ago but I thought I'd share the pictures, anyway. The whole family went out to San Francisco for my sister's (Paula) wedding and I took a bunch of pictures, which you can see by clicking the collage above. Highlights included attending a Giants game (check out the cool pics of Mr. Indicted...they are SWEET), seeing the Smashing Pumpkins at the Filmore (3+ hours...incredible), and the wine country out in Calistoga. Something about the house we stayed in in Calistoga gave me really bad sinus trouble...never could figure it out. My dad says it was the trees, and I can't argue with him. It was something and it made me miserable.

Without saying...Paula's wedding was the highlight of the trip. Hard to believe my littlest sister is married but that's life! I'm very happy for her and Alex. I've got another great brother-in-law now. (He helps with my landscaping questions, and also plays a decent guitar.)
