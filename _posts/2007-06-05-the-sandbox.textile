Last weekend I wrapped up construction of a sandbox for the kids. I had to wait on the canvas to arrive so it took a week longer than expected, but I think it turned out great. It's made primarily out of cedar, with pressure treated decking material for the bottom and the legs. The top is a roof with gables, rafters and the whole bit, wrapped in Sunbrella weatherproof canvas. It took about a day and a half to build, and the garage smells nice with the cedar sawdust! You can see more pictures by clicking on the image on right. They all look about the same, though!
