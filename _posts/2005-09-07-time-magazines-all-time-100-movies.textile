title: Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies
tags: []
---
A few months back, Time Magazine came up with their list of the "All-Time Top 100 Movies":http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/ as compiled by Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel.  Corliss has an interesting article on the site that describes the process of selecting the films for the list. The major criteria was that both men had to agree on a film for it to make the list. That, to me, would be a significant challenge. After comparing their lists, they found that they had 31 matches, which meant debate on the final 69. You can also see what films were close but didn't make the cut.

This list is a lot closer to Ebert's than to the AFI's, primarily because Ebert and Time included foreign films. There are some strange ones on here, though. Finding Nemo? Blade Runner? The Fly? Yojimbo and not the Seven Samurai?
