Get yer checkbooks and credit cards ready...I've got my own Amazon store here on JayDreyer.com. Just look up on the navigation bar for the cleverly titled "Store" link and click away. It's kind of cool, but I don't have a lot of control over it. I get to pick the 9 items on the first page, and the categories on the right. But, I don't have any control over what displays when you select a category. At least I haven't figured out how to do it, yet. So, Dixie Chicks albums may appear, or an Al Franken book. Just ignore and move on.

You can do all of your usual Amazon stuff here, plus my site even has a fancy shopping cart. Everything goes through Amazon, so if you're worried about me getting your personal info or tracking your shopping habits, forget about it. The only thing I'll ever know is if somebody buys something, I'll get a 5% cut. It doesn't tell me who bought what, though. When you checkout, it takes care of that through Amazon so I don't even get your credit card info.

Buy some stuff and make me some $$$! Have fun and let me know what you think about it.
