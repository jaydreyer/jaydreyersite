Congrats to my sister, Julie and her husband John on the birth of their second child today. It's a boy, but there's no name yet. I don't know what's up with that...9+ months seems like plenty of time to pick a name, but to each their own!  ;-)

Baby Rootes was born at 7:30am PDT, weighed in at 7lb 13oz (the same as I weighed, evidently), and tops out at 21 inches. From what I hear, everyone is doing just fine. 

As I learn more details and receive some pictures, I'll post them here...

*Update*
After a few days of what must have been intense negotiations, Julie and John have named their son Jules Minor. I know Minor (if I've spelled it correctly) is a Rootes family name. Jules is a new one to me!
