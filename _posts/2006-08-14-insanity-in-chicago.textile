I love Chicago...it's probably my favorite city in the U.S. Maybe it's because I have a lot of friends there, or the pizza, or the bars, or the incredible amount of things to see and do. I don't know what it is.

Anyway, I think Chicago is losing it. Now that they've banned smoking in the city, it looks like people have moved on to more serious issues. Reducing crime? Nope. Improving the schools? Uh uh. They've identified the new public enemy number one in the Windy City as none other than foie gras. That's right. Get it while you can because as of August 22nd, you'll have to head out to Schaumberg or Barrington to feed that foie gras fix. Nice job, Chicago city council! This would have made a good Sufjan Stevens song for Illinoise. Oh well.
