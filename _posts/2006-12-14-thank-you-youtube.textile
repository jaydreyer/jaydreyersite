I haven't posted in forever, and this doesn't really count, either, but, thanks to YouTube, here is one of my all time favorite tunes/videos, Mexican Radio by Wall of Voodoo. (That sentence should also win some type of award for most commas...)

I think I'll spend the next month or so just posting favorite YouTube clips. What do you think? Kind of my own VH1 80's flashback show or something.

"I'm on a Mexican, whoa, radio. Radio. Radio. Radio. What does he say?"

Also, Stan Ridgeway's head coming out of the pot of beans at the end of the clip has always stuck in my brain for some reason.
