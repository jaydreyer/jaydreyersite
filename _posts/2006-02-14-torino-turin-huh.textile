The Winter Olympics are going on right now. I couldn't care less, but my wife is a total junkie. Since NBC is showing it in HDTV glory, I've been sucked into watching a few things - primarily events that judges can't screw up. 

I'm not sure when I turned on the Olympics...I used to enjoy them but lately I almost dread them. Why? I'm not sure, but I think it's the endlessly hyped up controversy, scandals and whining that have turned me off. I think the best examples of what I'm talking about are the pairs figure skating debacle and the Ohno speed skating thing-a-ma-bob where all of South Korea went into an uproar. Whatever. 

If a judge isn't involved then I might watch the event - luge is neat, so is the downhill, bobsled and hockey. The one where they ski and shoot stuff. That's neat, too. Watching cross-country skiers just makes me tired. Ski jump is fun to watch, but judging is involved so I stay away. Skating pixies that cry after each round? Not for me.

Anyway, the whole point of this rambling post is to determine where these events are being held. You see, I'm confused here. I thought they were in Torino. That's what "this official looking site":http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/torino/index_uk.asp tells me. But when I scroll down the page, the same site that welcomes me to Torino gives me a historical recap by telling me about how the games were awarded to Turin in 1999:

Even better, this _paragraph_ can't decide what to call the location:

I hopped on Google to try and solve this dilemma, but initially I didn't have much luck. "Dream of Italy":http://www.dreamofitaly.com/public/135.cfm tells me that "Torino" is Italian and "Turin" is...something else. They also tell me, by the way, that Turin (or Torino) "is hardly the Detroit of Italy." Slammed from thousands of miles away! Damn!

Leave it to the good folks at "National Geographic":http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0206_060206_torino.html to put this issue to rest. It -turins- turns out that "Turin" is what the English speaking world has called "Torino" for years. The IOC normally uses the English version of the city name, but this time they relented to Italian pressure and switched it to Torino. I think Torino sounds better. I also think Detroit should have promoted the actual Michigan pronunciation of the city during the Super Bowl and used "San Diego". Sounds more exotic, no?
