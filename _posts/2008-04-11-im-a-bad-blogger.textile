OK. So I don't post anymore. It's not that I don't _want_ to post. I do. I really do. I'm just really lazy. Really. Lazy.

So I found a solution. Kind of. Well, sort of. I'm not sure. It's a site at tumblr. Yes, another site with a name that's missing a vowel. Ha. I set up a site at "http://kaline.tumblr.com/":http://kaline.tumblr.com/. It does what I want - it lets me post things quickly without jumping through a bunch of hoops, which is what slows me down at the moment. I'm pretty sure that's what's slowing me down.

It's pretty bare-bones, nothing fancy, just quick posts here and there. At some point I'm going to figure out how to manage all of this. Maybe combine things into jaydreyer.com, or move everything to Tumblr, or move everything to Wordpress. I don't know.

I'll keep you updated. All 5 of you. Hang in there!

Oh yeah...if you'd like to play along, I was thinking of getting another domain name. I named my tumblr blog "chop, chop" (Caddyshack) but, unfortunately, some wise soul already bought the domain name chopchop.com (bastard). Then I started looking for top notch. Yeah, gone, too. Way gone. I could buy it for $7500 or something, but I passed. My brain is stuck so help me out.
