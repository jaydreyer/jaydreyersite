Ack! ABC is killing me with their HD choices.

The Indianapolis 500, the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing", was obviously not a big enough spectacle to warrant coverage in HD. Why??? Let's review what could be seen on Sunday in HD: Pistons vs Heat on TNT, Red Sox vs Yankees on ESPN and the neverending Coca Cola 600 on Fox. (I think that race is still going on, and it looks like there's another yellow flag out...) The day's biggest event, however, was not in HD. I just don't understand what is going on over there at ABC sports. If you don't broadcast the Indy 500 in HD, then what on Earth will get the HD treatment? According to <a href="http://www.abc.com">ABC</a>, "My Wife and Kids", "George Lopez", and the classic "According to Jim" all get HD broadcasts, but not major sporting events like the 2nd round of the NBA playoffs or the Indy 500. I just don't get it.
