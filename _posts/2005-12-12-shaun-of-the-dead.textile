I finally got around to watching "_Shaun of the Dead_":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006A9FKA/jaydreyer-20 this past weekend and I have to say I loved it.

I won't go into the plot a great deal as there are tons of sites that can explain it much better than I can. My wife wasn't interested in watching it with me, but I think she'd would have liked it if she did. It's a very funny movie, but not in a slapstick kind of way (which is what DeAnne was expecting, I think). It's also a bit of a romantic comedy, which I didn't expect. I guess I should have read the bit on the cover that states, "A smash hit romantic comedy. With zombies." I think that sums it up perfectly.

If you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend checking it out or adding it to your Blockbuster/Netflix queue.
