Ahhhh...the Lions. What can I say about them? What can anyone say? They're bad. They've almost always been bad, and they will probably always be bad. There is nothing we can do about it. It is as inevitable as the tides.

After the Thanksgiving Day debacle at Ford Field, it was specualted that Mariucci would be fired as early as Friday. Friday came and went, and Mooch was still the coach. Saturday, Sunday, still the head coach. Monday rolls around, however, and now Mooch is out and Dick Jauron is in. Why the wait? Everyone knew this was going to happen so why did it take so long? I'd hazzard a guess but it's a waste of time. Trying to understand why the Lions do anything they do is not a productive use of brain power. The phrase "Lion's Logic" is popular here in Detroit for a reason.

Am I upset about the firing? Nope. Mariucci was not a good fit for this team. I was one of the many here in town that was happy when he was hired. But over time, it's been pretty obvious it was a bad fit. Mariucci ran the west coast offense but didn't have the players to execute it. Instead of modifying the system to fit the players, he stuck with the system. That might be why the Lions have the 27th ranked offense. There were also a lot of rumblings about a lack of discipline on the team. It was said that players took advantage of Mariucci's easy-going nature. Now the Lions will flip it back to the other end of the spectrum and pick up a hard-line disciplinarian again. Follow along with this pattern: Wayne Fontes (soft), Bobby Ross (tough), Morningwheg/Mooch (soft), [insert new tough guy here].

I think Mariucci would be a great college coach and should go the Pete Carroll route and take over a program somewhere. I believe he coached at Cal for a year or so before taking over the 49ers so he's done it before. I know a few people around town have been saying the MSU coaching job would be a perfect fit for him, but that would mean John L. Smith would have to go and I, for one, don't want to see it. The man is a walking quote machine. Plus, he hasn't beaten Michigan yet. I'd like him to stay for a long time.
