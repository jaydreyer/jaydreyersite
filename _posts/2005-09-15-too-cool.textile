Man...where was this when I was little? Lego has created the "Lego Factory":http://www.legofactory.com that lets you build your own creations on your computer. OK, that's kind of neat, but stay with me. The really cool part is that you can actually turn your design into a real Lego kit that the company will send to you in its own box. So, say you design your dream house out of Legos using the system. If you want, Lego can get all of the necessary pieces together, put them in a box and ship them to you. Now you have your very own, unique Lego set. Even cooler is that Lego is turning some of the designs into real kits that can be purchased by anyone. Amazing.
