Hey all! Long time, no blog! Lot's of new stuff happening so I'll get some stuff out soon. Anyhoo...here are some photos from the Scarecrow Festival we went to in Belle Plaine, MN. It was at "Emma Krumbee's Orchard and Farm":http://www.emmakrumbees.com/ . Can't say it was all that great, but the kids had fun, and Jack got to ride both a pony AND a camel, and not many people get to say they did that in the same day. Plus, someone made a Fonzie scarecrow. Enjoy!
