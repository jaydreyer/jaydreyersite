No, I haven't fallen off the face of the Earth...it's just been pretty crazy up here as of late. To tide you over, I've uploaded a few "new pictures of Jack and Lucy":http://flickr.com/photos/jaydreyer/sets/72157594354719729/ in their Halloween costumes.<br />

I'm not sure how it is everywhere else, but it was COLD here today. Below freezing during trick or treat time. I'm still warming back up. Poor Jack's little ears were all red. There was no slowing him down from accumulating candy for his father to eat, however. What a trooper.
