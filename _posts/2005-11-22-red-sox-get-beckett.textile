title: Red Sox get Beckett

So the Red Sox picked up Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell today for 3 minor leaguers. Interesting. Beckett sometimes is a fantastic pitcher. He's also guy with chronic blister problems and a really bizarre shoulder issue that is still being investigated. Lowell is a pretty good 3B, except for last year when I had him on my fantasy team. He killed me and I think he's near the end of his career. I don't know anything about the minor leaguers they gave up, but it looks like a pretty good deal for the Sox. It would be hard to pass on Beckett. I'd love to see him in a Tiger's uniform.

What I really want to know, though, is when Steve Philips will hold a simulated press conference on ESPN to discuss the deal. I can't wait!
