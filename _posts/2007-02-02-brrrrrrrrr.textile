Wow. Now I know I live in Minnesota. I woke up this morning to a brisk -8 degrees. But hey! It should get up to 7 today. That's much better than Saturday and Sunday's projected highs of -2. 

How can -2 be considered a high?

Needless to say we'll be locked in the house this weekend. DeAnne has been cooped up there for a week since the kids have been sick so I'm worried she'll pull a Jack Nicholson from the Shining if I don't get her out at some point.

I'm concerned because I saw, "All work and no play make DeAnne a dull girl" typed over and over again on her PC. Maybe she's just honing her typing skills.
