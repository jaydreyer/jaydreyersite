Cnet has come up with their new "Blog 100":http://news.com.com/2310-10784_3-0.html list, which supposedly identifies the top 100 blogs that are worth reading. There must be some mistake, however, because I did not see JayDreyer.com on the list. I looked it over three times and still can't find it. It must have been an oversight on CNet's part. I'm assuming that if they expanded the list to the CNet Blog 101, I would be listed.

After briefly perusing the list, I must admit that I feel totally out of it. I probably have been to a small handful of the blogs listed and only regularly read one or two of them. The good thing about lists like this, however, is that they introduce you to sites you might not be aware of. The only problem is, I'm running out of time in the day to keep up with all of these!

On a side note, CNet estimates there are currently 14,000,000 blogs in existence and 80,000 are created every day. Wow. There is a lot of useless information floating around out there.
