If you're looking for something new to listen to on your fancy-schmancy Ipod, here are a few suggestions for you that I've downloaded from eMusic recently...

(Let me add in here that, in general, I suck at music reviews...I either like it or I don't. When I try to explain why I like or dislike something, I end up sounding like an obnoxious music critic/music snob...and by all means I consider myself a music snob. That's why I like eMusic so much.)

<b>Brendan Benson
</b><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10739/10739039.html">Lapalco</a>

If you're into smart-pop music, you've come to the right place. From what I understand, Brendan is from Detroit, which is both cool and upsetting because why did it take me moving to Minneapolis from Detroit to find out about him? Most of the reviews you'll find compare him to Matthew Sweet, minus the crunchy guitars. I'm not sure I agree with that, but I like Matthew Sweet and I really like this album. Lots of catchy songs that stick in your brain long after you take the headphones off. As a side note, Brendan is a member of the Raconteurs along with Jack White from the White Stripes. So he's got that going for him.

<b>Gomez
</b><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10916/10916441.html">How We Operate</a>

I've been a big Gomez fan since <i>Bring it On </i>came out in 1998. They've switched labels and are now indie (great for me as it's available on emusic) but the music is still great. They're an interesting band in that you never know what you're going to get from song to song. I think there are three different people that take turns as lead singer. Overall, this is probably their most consistent album from beginning to end.

<b>Spoon
</b><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10859/10859774.html">Gimmie Fiction</a>

This is the third Spoon album I've purchased and it's far and away my favorite (although I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10875/10875622.html">Girls Can Tell.</a>..) This is where I need my inner rock critic to come out and describe the album because I have a hard time describing them to people. They don't really rock, per se, but it's not a bunch of slow, moody tunes, either. You can listen to samples on emusic to get a better understanding. There are a lot of great songs on this disc and the production is really interesting. I usually hear something new with each listen.

<b>The New Pornographers
</b><a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10865/10865145.html">Twin Cinema</a>

I'll wrap things up with what is probably my favorite album of the last couple years. Again, if you're into the rock-pop thing, if you don't have this one already I'm not sure what you're waiting for. My friend Pete says <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10777/10777064.html">Electric Version</a> is better than this one. I can't say because although I own all of their albums, I like Twin Cinema so much I rarely play the others. (Note to self, listen to the other albums sometime.) The New Pornographers is dubbed a "super group" from Canada consisting of members of various Vancouver based bands. They're led by A.C. Newman (who also has an excellent CD available from emusic - <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10826/10826284.html">The Slow Wonder</a>) but there are three people that take turns with lead vocals. When I first downloaded it I think I listened to it every day for about two months. I just couldn't stop playing it. AllMusic describes it as: "<b><i>Jubilant hooks and roaring choruses make </i>Twin Cinema<i> a perfect panacea for us pop fans.</i></b>" I think that sums it up fairly well.
