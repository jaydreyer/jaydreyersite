Did these things just come out or have I been under a rock for too long? I am totally addicted to these damn Sudoku puzzles. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can try one out at "Sudoku Online":http://www.sudoku.org.uk/daily.asp. It's a huge time waster, but it's also a good way to keep your brain sharp.
