Believe it or not (and I won't blame you if you fall into the "not" camp), I get complaints that my Amazon wish list is too hard to find. I believe this is true because I don't receive goodies in the mail every week from Amazon. So, to make it easier for everyone to buy me stuff, if you look on the right hand side of the web site you'll see the fancy new Amazon Wish-List widget. You can scroll through it, mock my selections, and then order whatever you want. Have fun and go nuts!
