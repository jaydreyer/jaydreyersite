Just a fantastic picture of my friends Ryan and John. The Sox ended up losing the game 5-0 and were shut out by the always dangerous Shawn Chacon. 

It was the 40th anniversary of the Beatles playing at Comiskey park so they had about 8 or 9 Beatles cover bands all over the place. A special hat's off to Pete Best who threw out the first pitch. If you don't know who he is, Pete Best was the original drummer for the Beatles before they kicked him out and added Ringo. No word on if "Clarence Walker":http://snltranscripts.jt.org/83/83lrocknroll.phtml was in the house.
