It figures. I lived in Detroit for 15 years and the Tigers were horrible. I move to Minneapolis and they start out 5-0. It's a long season but it's nice to see them get off to a good start for once. Usually they drop 8 of their first 10 and start out the season behind the 8 ball.

It's especially nice to see the pitching staff getting off to a good start.  All 5 starters won their first starts of the season. Verlander and Bonderman looked especially strong. And what can I say about Chris Shelton? What a start! In 5 games he's batting .700(!) with 5 homers and 9 rbi. With the Tigers luck, they'll probably drop the next 10 games but I'll try to stay positive.

162-0!
