Ugh. I hate to be the grammar police, and I know I'm far from perfect, but this just shouldn't happen. If *you're* a big corporation and *you're* going to email *your* customers about a sale, it is *your* responsibility to proofread the email.

But, maybe this is to be expected from a company that uses the tagline "We got it. We get it." I'm assuming what they "got" are  computers and not proofreaders.
