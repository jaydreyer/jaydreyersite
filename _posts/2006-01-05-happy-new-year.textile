Happy New Year to all six of my regular readers. The whole house is sick so finding time to write anything has been a bit tough lately. Plus, I have little to write about so that hasn't helped, either.

But, while I was enjoying a few pops at my friend Joe's house watiting for the ball to drop at midnight, there appeared before me two images that sent a shiver down my spine.

The first of these images was that of Dick Clark on the Rockin' New Years-whatever-fest on ABC. Now, I like Dick Clark and I have a HUGE amount of respect for him. But I'll admit it, I was a little creeped out by him on TV. I understand that he had a stroke, and I give him credit for going out there despite his limitations, but it was still tough to watch. At least it was for me. I haven't read too much about the reaction to his hosting the show so I might be in a tiny minority that thinks this way (or at least the tiny minority that admits it). It was just tough seeing him like that after watching him do the show for years and years. I read somewhere that he was an inspiration for stroke sufferers, so I guess that's good. Those are my thoughts on that. [Despite his condition, he's still better than that Ryan Seacrest goof and whatever chick-of-the-year they brought out this year.]

The next image that both frightens and amazes me is that of Iggy Pop. Iggy Pop was born in April, 1947. That means he's getting close to 60 freakin' years old (only 4 years younger than Mick Jagger). And Iggy ROCKS (unlike Jagger)! Some station (VH1? VH1E? MTV? MTV2? MTV33?) showed an Iggy Pop concert well after midnight on New Years Eve/Day and it was amazing. The man is a dynamo. I don't know how he does it, and really, I'm not sure I want to know. If you don't know who I'm talking about, here's a picture:
