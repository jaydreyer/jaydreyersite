I woke up this morning to find out the Lions hired Rod Marinelli as their new coach. I'm glad to see Millen stuck with his overriding requirement of head coaches having a last name starting with the letter 'M'. This bodes well for the future.

I don't have much to say about the hiring. I think most would agree the pool of available applicants didn't blow anyone away. Other options were Jim Haslett and Russ Grimm, but neither of them do much for me, either.

I'll be honest, I have no idea who will and who won't make a good head football coach. I was excited when Mariucci was hired, and we saw how well that went. No matter what anyone tells me, there is no "super coach" that can win anywhere at any time with any team. Everyone's idea of a coaching genius, Bill Belichick, was pretty bad when he was leading Cleveland. Bill Parcells has made the playoffs once in his three years at Dallas. And New England's whipping boy, Pete Carroll, was horrible with the Patriots and can now (almost) do no wrong at USC.

So, with that being said, I had to laugh when I listened to the callers on 1130 today complaining about the hire, or the articles by Rob Parker and Drew Sharp in the Detroit News and Free Press blasting the selection. Was there anyone available that stood out, head and shoulders, above anyone else? I don't think so. Marinelli sounds like a very interesting guy and I'm all for his ideas on accountability. I also like the lineage from Tony Dungy, which also includes Herm Edwards and Lovie Smith. 

We'll see what happens come September.
