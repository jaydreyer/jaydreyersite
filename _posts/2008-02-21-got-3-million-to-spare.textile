Wow. Almost as surprising as me entering a post on my blog is the size of <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=140206309501">this guy's music collection</a>. Amazing. All for the low, low price of $3 million (that's the starting point, btw). My collection fits in 6 big plastic tubs and 100GB of hard drive space (not counting my Duran Duran and Huey Lewis vinyl, those are on loan to the Smithsonian right now.) As you can see, this collection needs slightly more space.

FYI, you have to pay shipping charges for this. I'm not sure what UPS charges to ship 3 million albums and 300,000 CDs. Maybe the white board guy can figure that out for me.
