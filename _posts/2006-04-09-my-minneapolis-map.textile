I made this Google Map so you could get an idea of where I am here in downtown Minneapolis. If you zoom out, you'll see some other markers, including one for our new house in Plymouth. Click on the markers for more information. I don't know if this works in Internet Explorer or not, but it definitely works with Firefox.
