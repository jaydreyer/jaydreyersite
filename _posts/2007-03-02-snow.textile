Beginning last Saturday, we've been dumped on here in Minnesota. I took some pictures but I'm afraid they don't really do it justice. I think we've got about 2 feet of snow on the ground right now and there's still a little more falling right now. Click on the picture and you should be able to see the rest of the set.
