I just wanted to give a quick shout out to the mental giants at "MDOT":http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/. This morning as I headed to work on I-75 I noticed that over the weekend they tore out the old blacktop to prepare for a new surface. Fine. This stretch of I-75 from 8 Mile to 696 is pretty bad and could use it. What ticked me off and ruined my morning, however, was that they also tore out big chunks of concrete and did not bother to fill them in with anything. So, when my 93 fell into one of these newly formed craters, pop went my driver's side tire.

Have you ever tried to replace a flat tire on the side of a busy highway? It's not fun. In fact, it's really dangerous. I stupidly changed the tire myself, but I should have called AAA. Thankfully a nice guy pulled over to see if I needed any help. I didn't, but I appreciated the offer. 

Once the spare was in place, I was off to Discount Tire where I ended up replacing 3 of the tires. The fourth was replaced a couple months back. Great way to start off the week. Thanks MDOT. Your bill is in the mail. And I'm sure I'll never see a cent.
