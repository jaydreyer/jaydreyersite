This is the "American Film Institute's":http://www.afi.com list of the 100 Greatest Movies, selected by AFI's blue-ribbon panel of more than 1,500 leaders of the American movie community.

I've seen the -crossed out items- and haven't seen the ones in *bold*.

h3. Random Notes:

All in all, this is a pretty good list. Just keep in mind it's American films only. If you want a good list with international films, check out "Roger Ebert's":http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist. Whenever I make it through this list, I'll start on his. Could be a while, though.

Luckily, "Blockbuster Online":http://www.blockbuster.com has most of these movies. A few, however, are not available on DVD so I set up my Tivo to try and catch them. I might have to break down and watch them on VHS. Sniff, sniff.

There are a few films on the AFI list that I felt were not all that great - specifically  "Midnight Cowboy" and "Easy Rider".  "Chinatown" didn't do much for me, either.  Those are the only ones I haven't really enjoyed. I was surprised how much I liked "City Lights" and "Mutiny on the Bounty". "Duck Soup" also cracked me up, which I didn't expect. I guess some humor really is timeless.
